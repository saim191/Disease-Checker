It helps users enter their symptoms and get:

- Possible conditions based on combinations of symptoms  
- Suggested over-the-counter medicines with dosage and warnings  
- A clear disclaimer that this is **not** a replacement for a real doctor

> ⚠️ MedBot is for educational/demo purposes only and must **not** be used as professional medical advice.
